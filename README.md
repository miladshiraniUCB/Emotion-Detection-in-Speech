# Emotion-Detection-in-Speech

The information in speech is conveyed through words and emotion. Depending on how one 
pronounces a word, we can understand different meaning. Therefore, both the word 
and the way it is pronounced affect our understaning of the word. As a result, 
it would be important that we could design a virtual assistant that not onldy 
does understand the word, but also it understands the emotion in the way the word
is pronounced. 

In this work, we are trying to introduce a machine learning model that can detect the
emotion in the sentence. In order to do so, we are using the audio data provided 
by [University of Toronto](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487) 
to create a neural network model to detect the emotion in a speech. In oreder to 
make a model we need to convert the audio files into numerical values. 


Therefore, important that an intelligent machine convert both words and emotion of a speech
into numbers. In this work,
