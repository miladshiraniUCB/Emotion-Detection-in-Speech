# Emotion-Detection-in-Speech

The information in speech is conveyed through words and emotion. Therefore, it is
important that an intelligent machine convert both words and emotion of a speech
into numbers. In this work, are using the audio data provided by [University of Toronto](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487) to create a neural network model
to detect the emotion in a speech.
